    "- Ensures high-quality, coherent data\n",
    "- Avoids token limit issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual Awareness**: Each generation request includes previously generated data as context, preventing duplicates and ensuring variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fine-tune our model with RFT, **we will only interact with this synthetic database.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Real World üåç**: This pattern is directly applicable. You would use the same approach with your production schema to generate synthetic data that maintains the statistical properties and relationships of your real data without exposing any actual records."

    "### 16. ‚ú® Cleanup & Conclusion\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully completed the entire Reinforcement Fine-Tuning loop. You started with just a database schema and ended with a highly specialized, performant, and data-aware AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cleanup\n",
    "Cloud resources and model deployments can incur costs, so it's good practice to clean up any resources you no longer need.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Check your Deployments:** Navigate to the [Deployments tab](https://app.fireworks.ai/dashboard/deployments) in your Fireworks AI dashboard. Here you can monitor and manage all your deployed models.\n",
    "*   **Delete Unneeded Models:** Feel free to delete any deployments you no longer need. For example, you might have deployed the base or large-base models during the evaluation step to compare against your fine-tuned model. These can now be safely removed to save costs.\n",
    "*   **Delete Cloud Run service and container image:** Feel free to delete your MCP server Cloud Run service and container image to avoid stray storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can, of course, continue using your new fine-tuned SQL generation model for any application you see fit!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusions\n",
    "The evaluation results from the previous step highlight the power of this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Performance on par with massive models:** Our fine-tuned 7B parameter model performs on par, or even better, than a much larger model like `qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507` on this specific dataset. This is because it has been fine-tuned to understand the data schema via real query generation and execution.\n",
    "*   **Efficiency Gains:** A 7B model is significantly faster and cheaper to run than a 235B one, offering production-grade performance at a fraction of the cost and latency.\n",
    "*   **High-Level Capability on Complex Tasks:** The queries in this dataset are relatively complex, which is reflected in the final accuracy score of around 60%. This is a strong result, demonstrating that for a specialized domain, a smaller model can be tuned to achieve a level of performance comparable to much larger models like `qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507`. Specifically, the final accuracy scores we measured for this dataset were:\n",
    "    - Qwen2.5 7B (base): **42.22%** accuracy (**38/90** correct on the held-out test set)\n",
    "    - Qwen3 235B Instruct (base): **53.33%** accuracy (**48/90** correct on the held-out test set)\n",
    "    - Qwen2.5 7B (RFT tuned): **57.78%** accuracy (**52/90** correct on the held-out test set)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we demonstrated a complete, end-to-end workflow for creating a fine-tuned text-to-SQL model. We began with the absolute minimum requirement, a database schema, and used a series of LLM-driven steps to generate a safe, synthetic data sandbox. From there, we generated a rich dataset of queries and answers, which we used to fine-tune a model using the Fireworks RFT platform. The final result is a small, efficient model that can accurately query data it has never seen, a task that was previously only possible with vastly larger and more expensive models.\n",

    "This pattern of **schema ‚Üí synthetic data ‚Üí RFT** is a secure, effective, and repeatable methodology for teaching language models to become expert users of your private data and custom APIs, without ever exposing the underlying sensitive information."
